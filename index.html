                            It will be for one complete revolution of the command module.
                            One of the first things that Armstrong and Aldrin will do
                            after getting their next stay-no stay will
                            be to remove their helmets and gloves.

                        <p>Houston, Monday, July 21&mdash;Men have landed and walked on the moon.</p>
                        <p>
                            Two Americans, astronauts of Apollo 11, steered their fragile four-legged
                            lunar module safely and smoothly to the historic landing yesterday
                            at 4:17:40 P.M., Eastern daylight time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Neil A. Armstrong, the 38-year-old civilian commander,
                            radioed to earth and the mission control room here:
                        </p>
                        <p>"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."</p>
                        <p>
                            The first men to reach the moon&mdash;Mr. Armstrong and his co-pilot,
                            Col. Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr. of the Air Force&mdash;brought
                            their ship to rest on
                            a level, rock-strewn plain near the southwestern shore of the arid
                            Sea of Tranquility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            About six and a half hours later,
                            Mr. Armstrong opened the landing craft's hatch,
                            stepped slowly down the ladder and declared as he planted
                            the first human footprint on the lunar crust:
                        </p>
                        <p>"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."</p>
                        <p>
                            His first step on the moon came at 10:56:20 P.M., as a television camera
                            outside the craft transmitted his every move to an awed and excited audience
                            of hundreds of millions of people on earth.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Tentative Steps Test Soil</h5>
                        <p>
                            Mr. Armstrong's initial steps were tentative tests of the lunar soil's
                            firmness and of his ability to move about easily in his bulky white spacesuit
                            and backpacks and under the influence of lunar gravity, which is
                            one-sixth that of the earth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "The surface is fine and powdery," the astronaut reported.
                            "I can pick it up loosely with my toe. It does adhere in fine layers like
                            powdered charcoal to the sole and sides of my boots. I only go in a small
                            fraction of an inch, maybe an eighth of an inch. But I can see the footprints
                            of my boots in the treads in the fine sandy particles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After 19 minutes of Mr. Armstrong's testing,
                            Colonel Aldrin joined him outside the craft.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The two men got busy setting up another television camera out from
                            the lunar module, planting an American flag into the ground, scooping
                            up soil and rock samples, deploying scientific experiments and hopping
                            and loping about in a demonstration of their lunar agility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They found walking and working
                            on the moon less taxing than had been forecast.
                            Mr. Armstrong once reported he was "very comfortable."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And people back on earth found the black-and-white television pictures
                            of the bug- shaped lunar module and the men tramping about it so sharp
                            and clear as to seem unreal, more like a toy and toy-like figures than human
                            beings on the most daring and far- reaching expedition thus far undertaken.
